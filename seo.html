      <h2>Tales of Suspense #39</h2>
	  <img src="taleofsuspense.jpg" height="300px" width="200px" /><br><br>
	  <a class="ui blue ribbon label">Comic : Marvel</a><br>
	  <a class="ui red ribbon label">Starting of the Legacy : Iron Man</a>
	  <li>Issue #39 (March 1963) introduced the superhero <a data-tooltip="Anthony Edward Stark is a character portrayed by Robert Downey Jr. in the Marvel Cinematic Universe film franchise">Iron Man</a>, created by editor and plotter Lee, scripter Lieber, and artists Heck and <a data-tooltip="Creator of Spider man, Captain America, Hulk, Black Panther etc">Jack Kirby</a>.
	     He starred in generally 13-page but occasionally 18-page adventures, with the rest of Tales of Suspense devoted to the anthological science fiction
         and fantasy stories the comic normally ran.
	  </li><br>
	  <li>After debuting with bulky gray armor, Iron Man was redesigned with similar but golden armor in his second
		 story (issue #40, April 1963). The first iteration of the modern, sleek red-and-golden armor appeared in #48 (Dec. 1963), drawn by <a data-tooltip="Creator of Spider Man, Doctor Strange, Mr A, Dormammu etc">Ditko</a>(though whether
		 he or Kirby, singly or in collaboration, designed it, is uncertain). From #53-58 (May-Oct. 1964), the cover logo was "Tales of Suspense featuring The Power of Iron Man".
	  </li><br> 
	  <li>Two months before the debut of the sorcerer-hero Doctor Strange, Lee, Kirby and scripter Robert Bernstein, under the pseudonym "R. Berns", introduced
		 a same-name criminal scientist and Ph.D., Carl Strange. Making his sole appearance in the Iron Man story "The Stronghold of Dr. Strange" in Tales of Suspense #41 (May 1963),
		 the character gained mental powers in a freak lightning strike. The Mandarin debuted in issue #50 (Feb. 1964) and would become one of Iron Man's major enemies.
	  </li><br>	
	  <li>The Black Widow first appeared in #52 (April 1964) and Hawkeye followed five issues later. The first Marvel superhero work by future company editor-in-chief Roy Thomas was his scripting
		 the Iron Man story "My Life for Yours" in #73 (Jan. 1966), working from a plot by editor Lee as well as a plot assist from Marvel secretary-receptionist Flo Steinberg. 
	  </li><br>
	  <li>From #49–58
		 (Jan.–Oct. 1964), one anthological story each issue acquired a framing sequence and ran as "Tales of the Watcher," narrated by the namesake cosmic witness introduced in The Fantastic
		 Four #13 and used as a Marvel Universe supporting character since. The final "Tales of the Watcher" story introduced veteran artist George Tuska as a Marvel regular. 
		 Four years later, Tuska would become one of Iron Man's signature artists.

    <li>In this video lesson, you will learn how to count quarter notes within

    <li>In this video drum lesson, you are going to learn how to count eight notes.

    <li>In this video lesson, you will learn how to count and play sixteenth notes. 
	    They are to eighth notes what eighth notes are to quarter notes. In other words,

    <li>PThe video on this page explains how to count eighth note triplets. Unlike quarter, 
	    eighth, sixteenth, and thirty-second note sub-divisions that divide time in half - 
		eighth note triplets actually devide quarter notes in three. In other words, one 
		quarter note is equal to three eighth note triplets.
